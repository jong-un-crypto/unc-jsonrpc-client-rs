## Usage

Each one of the valid JSON RPC methods are defined in the `methods` module.
For instance, to make a `tx` request, you start with the `tx` module
and construct a request using the `methods::tx::RpcTransactionStatusRequest` struct.

```rust
use unc_jsonrpc_client::{methods, JsonRpcClient};
use unc_jsonrpc_primitives::types::transactions::TransactionInfo;

let mainnet_client = JsonRpcClient::connect("https://archival-rpc.mainnet.unc.org");

let tx_status_request = methods::tx::RpcTransactionStatusRequest {
    transaction_info: TransactionInfo::TransactionId {
        hash: "9FtHUFBQsZ2MG77K3x3MJ9wjX3UT8zE1TczCrhZEcG8U".parse()?,
        account_id: "miraclx.unc".parse()?,
    },
};

// call a method on the server via the connected client
let tx_status = mainnet_client.call(tx_status_request).await?;

println!("{:?}", tx_status);
```

## Releasing

Versioning and releasing of this crate is automated and managed by [custom fork](https://github.com/miraclx/cargo-workspaces/tree/grouping-versioning-and-exclusion) of [`cargo-workspaces`](https://github.com/pksunkara/cargo-workspaces). To publish a new version of this crate, you can do so by bumping the `version` under the `[workspace.metadata.workspaces]` section in the [package manifest](https://github.com/unc/unc-jsonrpc-client-rs/blob/master/Cargo.toml) and submit a PR.

We have CI Infrastructure put in place to automate the process of publishing all crates once a version change has merged into master.

However, before you release, make sure the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/unc/unc-jsonrpc-client-rs/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) is up to date and that the `[Unreleased]` section is present but empty.
